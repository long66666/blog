Yesterdayï¼šI finally build a blog site using github page and started writing blogs.I went to bed lately around 24:00,which i don't think it's a good idea.Last but not least,yesterday i tried build a online store using wordpress and woocommerce plug-in.Honestly,it's very easy to set up but the payment methods are kind of complex which need me to choose and figure out the ways to set up for my store.

Today:Get up kind of lately but i think it's still ok.When i was alone myself downstairs,i felt a little hopeless wondering my decision quiting my job will hurt others that care about me.

At the end,I want to tell myself something to remind,"You still have the world,you can feel ok with something and choose to believe somethings,all you need to do is nerver give up!"
